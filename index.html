      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Jane of all trades, master of some. I've worked in marketing most of my career focused on digital platforms and developing web sites and creatives.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Maine, but lived all over the east coast until moving West a few years ago.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love gaming, reading, dancing, traveling, and snuggling my girls <em>(my absolute favorite thing)</em>.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Professional slacker, but I'll settle for freelance web designer/developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Chandler, AZ</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm a certified Web Master, which means very little these days. My present job requires me to use my web skills, but on a very limited basis. With the pandemic, I could easily lose my job in a few months and want to be able to keep doing what I love.</p>
